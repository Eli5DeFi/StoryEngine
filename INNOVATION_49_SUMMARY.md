## 🔮 Top Pick: Prophecy NFTs

**The most viral, immediately buildable innovation.**

- AI generates 10-20 cryptic prophecies before each chapter
- Readers mint any prophecy as an NFT (5 $FORGE, 100 max per prophecy)
- After chapter resolution: NFT art transforms based on accuracy
  - ❌ Unfulfilled → Dark relic (still collectible)
  - 🥈 Echoed → Silver artifact (thematic match, 3× value)
  - 🏆 Fulfilled → Legendary golden artifact (direct match, 10× value)
- Oracle Pack: mint 20 prophecies at 10% discount
- 5% royalty on all secondary sales

**POC Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
