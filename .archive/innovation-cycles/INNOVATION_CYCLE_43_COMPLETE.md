## 🗓️ Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-10)
- Mobile feed beta
- Remix engine MVP
- Real-world oracles
- **Target:** $50K revenue

### Phase 2: Competition (Weeks 11-20)
- Tournament system
- AI showdowns
- **Target:** $250K cumulative revenue

### Phase 3: Launch (Weeks 21-30)
- Audits + polish
- Marketing blitz
- Mainnet deployment
- **Target:** 10,000 users, $100K/month

## ✨ Why This Works

### Viral Flywheel

```
More users 
  → More remixes (UGC)
  → More betting volume
  → Higher tournament prizes
  → More competition
  → More showdowns (drama)
  → More media coverage (RW hooks)
  → More users ✅
```

### Network Effects

1. **UGC Creation:** Every reader = creator
2. **Social Proof:** Leaderboards = status games
3. **FOMO:** "I could win $10K"
4. **Sunk Cost:** Entry fees + time invested
5. **Streaks:** Win streaks = addiction
6. **Influencers:** Social betting = copy-trading

### Switching Cost → ∞

After 6 months users have:
- Remix portfolio (can't export)
- Tournament ranking (platform-specific)
- Influence tokens (non-transferable)
- Social following (network-dependent)
- NFT trophies (Voidborne-only)

**Leave = lose everything**
