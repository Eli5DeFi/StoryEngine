- More skill tiers → better matchmaking
- Winner-take-most dynamics

### 3. Privacy + Transparency
- ZK pools = whale magnet (privacy premium)
- Public pools = mass market (transparency)
- Best of both worlds
- Different products for different users

### 4. Retention Mastery
- DDB = 2.5x new player retention
- Bet-to-Earn = losers stay (yield softens loss)
- Personalized AI = emotional stickiness
- **Combined = 5-10x LTV increase**

### 5. First-Mover Advantage
- No competitor has biometric voting
- No competitor has emotion-adaptive AI
- No competitor has Bet-to-Earn narratives
- Patent potential (biometric voting, NRE algorithm)
- **12-24 month head start**

### Technical Complexity
✅ **Mitigated:**
- Hire ZK experts (Circom specialists)
- Security audits ($50K-$100K budget)
- Bug bounty program ($100K pool)
- Insurance coverage (smart contract insurance)

### User Trust
✅ **Built:**
- Open-source ZK circuits (community review)
- Audited smart contracts (public reports)
- Gradual rollout (beta → limited → public)
- Transparent communication (blog posts, AMAs)
