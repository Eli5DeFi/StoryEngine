## Temporary Placeholder Solution

If you don't have images yet, the page will still work. The dark gradients will show as backgrounds. You can:

1. Use free stock images from:
   - Unsplash (unsplash.com)
   - Pexels (pexels.com)
   - Pixabay (pixabay.com)

2. Search terms to find suitable images:
   - "dark throne gothic"
   - "cosmic portal nebula"
   - "cyberpunk silhouette"
   - "sci-fi landscape dark"

3. Or generate AI images using:
   - Midjourney
   - DALL-E
   - Stable Diffusion
   
## Alternative: Use Gradient Backgrounds

If you prefer pure gradients without images, update the components to remove the `backgroundImage` styles and rely only on the gradient overlays.
