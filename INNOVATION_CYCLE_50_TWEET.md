House Obsidian just bet 1,200 USDC against the crowd on Chapter 22.

They think Commander Zara covers up the Void Stitching.

Do you agree with the house of shadows?

Or is this your chance to go contrarian against an AI with 68% accuracy? 🎭

After 47 bets, your Narrative DNA has crystallized.

🧬 Archetype: "The Grand Schemer"

Political Complexity: ████████░░ 81%  
Betrayal Affinity: █████████░ 87%  
House Allegiance: OBSIDIAN

Mint it as an NFT. Trade it. Wear it. It's who you are in the Void.

**Tweet 4 (SSP):**
In Voidborne, skill is a financial asset.

65% prediction accuracy → Oracle tier
75% accuracy → Sage tier → 8% APY from Wisdom Pool

Less skilled players pay a 1% premium on bets.
That premium flows to Sages.

Proof of skill. On-chain. Forever.

New: Story Parameter Markets

Don't just bet A or B.

Bet on:
📊 Void Corruption Index: Currently 47 → Will it hit 60?
⚔️ Alliance Strength: Valdris-Obsidian pact cracking?
👑 Throne Stability: Is the Silent Throne safe?

Continuous prediction markets. Chapter by chapter.

**Tweet 6 (CUB):**
When Chapter 30 resolves, the story doesn't end.

It FORKS.

If Commander Zara exposes the Stitchers → "The Stitcher Trials" launches
If she covers it up → "The Shadow Parliament" begins

Same $FORGE. Same reputation. New universe.

The Void is infinite.

**Title:** Voidborne Innovation Cycle #50: Teaching AI Story Characters to Have Economic Skin in the Game

Every prior iteration of Voidborne has treated the AI-generated characters as narrative props. The readers make predictions. The AI chooses. The story progresses.

Innovation Cycle #50 changes the fundamental architecture: the characters themselves become autonomous economic agents.

**What we built:**

1. **House Agent Protocol** — Five AI agents (one per political house) hold real Base wallets funded with $FORGE. Each agent analyzes story chapters through its house's ideological lens using Claude, sizes bets using Kelly Criterion, and adapts its personality matrix after each outcome. House Obsidian's agent has learned to bet contrarian. House Meridian's agent sticks with crowd consensus. Both strategies are visible, trackable, and beatable.

2. **Narrative DNA Engine** — A player's 12-dimension betting history vector personalizes future AI chapter generation. Heavy betrayal bettor? Claude will subtly add more loyalty ambiguity to your chapters. Contrarian? Choices become harder to read. Your story gradually becomes yours.

3. **Sage Staking Protocol** — Prediction accuracy is now a financial asset. 75%+ accuracy over 500 bets unlocks Sage tier and the right to stake into the Wisdom Pool, earning passive USDC yield from less-skilled bettors' premiums. Skill compounds.

The result is a narrative ecosystem where every actor — human and AI — has genuine economic stakes in the story's direction. This is where prediction markets meet interactive fiction at their logical intersection.

POC: Full TypeScript implementation on `innovation/autonomous-character-agents` branch.

**Title:** Built autonomous AI agents with real crypto wallets that bet on their own story choices (POC inside)

The concept: a narrative prediction market where you bet on which choice an AI narrator will make. Standard stuff.

The innovation: deploy AI agents representing each political faction in the story. Each agent holds a real Base wallet, reads the story through its faction's ideological lens, and bets real $FORGE on outcomes it thinks benefits its house.

Then players bet WITH or AGAINST the agents. The agent leaderboard becomes a meta-game. Players form house allegiances, earning 20% of agent winnings.

POC uses Claude's API for reasoning, Kelly Criterion for position sizing, and an evolutionary personality matrix that adapts each agent's risk tolerance and contrarianism based on outcomes.

Full TypeScript implementation: `house-agents.ts` in the innovation branch.

Questions? Happy to discuss the architecture.
