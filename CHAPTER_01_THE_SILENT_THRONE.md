The observation deck of Valdris Station offered a view that few in the galaxy could claim: the entire Grand Conclave assembled in one place.

Kaelen Valdris stood at the reinforced glass, hands clasped behind her back, watching the five dreadnoughts maintain their uneasy orbit. Each ship represented one of the Great Houses—massive vessels that served as both home and fortress for humanity's ruling elite.

*House Vor.* The crimson warship bristled with weapons, a flying fortress that had crushed three rebellions in the last decade alone.

*House Veyron.* Industrial gray and scarred from a thousand mining operations, its holds full of resources extracted from dead worlds.

*House Kaelen.* Sleek black, its hull crawling with sensor arrays and quantum processors—watching everything, knowing everything.

*House Maris.* White and gold, the banker's palace, where debts were tracked with the precision of atomic clocks.

*House Seren.* Bio-organic curves of purple and green, where human modification had become an art form verging on the divine.

And below them all, her station. *House Valdris.* Holder of the Silent Throne. Master of the Thread.

Or she would be, if she could prove she deserved it.

"Heir Valdris." The voice came from behind her. Admiral Zhang Wei, her military advisor, emerged from the shadows. His augmented eyes glowed faintly in the dim light. "The Conclave convenes in one hour. All five Houses are demanding answers."

"Let them demand." Kaelen didn't turn from the window. "The Thread is my family's legacy, not theirs."

"Forgive me, Heir, but that legacy is precisely what terrifies them." Zhang stepped closer, his voice dropping. "Someone is Stitching. Not just reading the Thread—*weaving new patterns.* Reality itself is being altered, and it's happening here, in Valdris space."

Kaelen's jaw tightened. Stitching. The art of manipulating the Thread—the quantum substrate underlying all reality—had been lost for three hundred years. Her great-grandmother, the last true Threader, had sealed the knowledge before her death, warning that Stitching could unravel existence itself.

"Impossible," Kaelen said, but her voice carried no conviction. She'd felt it herself. Strange déjà vu. Memories that didn't quite fit. Ships arriving at coordinates they'd never been given.

"The Houses believe you're responsible," Zhang said quietly. "They think Valdris has secretly preserved the Stitching arts and is using them to consolidate power."

"That's absurd."

"Is it?" Zhang's augmented eyes flickered. "Three months ago, House Veyron's mining colony at Kepler-442 reported finding an intact Thread Node—a device that should not exist. Two months ago, House Kaelen's surveillance network detected quantum anomalies near our borders. Last month, House Maris discovered discrepancies in their financial records spanning twenty years—transactions that happened differently than anyone remembers."

Kaelen finally turned to face him. "And House Vor?"

"Admiral Tor reports that his warship fleet conducted exercises last week that they have no memory of planning. The mission logs exist. The fuel was consumed. But no one remembers giving the order."

A chill ran down Kaelen's spine. Reality was coming loose at the seams.

"Someone is Stitching," Zhang repeated. "The question is: what are you going to do about it?"

## The Conclave Chamber

The Grand Conclave met in a spherical chamber at the heart of Valdris Station. Five throne platforms floated in zero gravity, arranged in a pentagon around the central dais where Kaelen now stood.

The representatives had arrived.

**Lady Elara Vor,** Military Commander of House Vor, her red uniform impeccable, her hand never far from her plasma sidearm.

**Director Cassius Veyron,** his body augmented with industrial mining gear, more machine than man, calculating profit margins even as he spoke.

**The Watcher,** House Kaelen's enigmatic representative, their true identity hidden behind a featureless black mask and layers of encryption.

**Archon Livia Maris,** dressed in flowing white robes, her neural implants glowing softly as she monitored financial flows across seventeen star systems in real-time.

**Doctor Phaedra Seren,** her skin shimmering with bio-luminescent patterns, her genome rewritten so many times she barely qualified as human anymore.

And then there was Captain Reyes, the wild card. An independent operator who commanded the *Drift Runner,* a ship that owed allegiance to no House. Reyes had been invited as a neutral observer—and potential scapegoat if things went wrong.

"Heir Valdris." Lady Vor's voice cut through the chamber like a blade. "Three hundred years your House has held the Silent Throne. Three hundred years you've promised the Thread would remain sealed, unused, safe. Yet now reality itself fractures around us. Explain."

Kaelen activated her own platform, rising to meet Vor eye-to-eye. "House Valdris did not cause this. We are investigating—"

"Investigating?" Director Veyron's voice rumbled like grinding gears. "You expect us to believe someone else has mastered Stitching? An art your House kept secret for millennia?"

"We kept nothing," Kaelen said sharply. "The Thread was sealed. The techniques were lost. My great-grandmother ensured that."

"Then how," The Watcher's voice synthesized and distorted, "do our surveillance nets detect Thread activity emanating from this very station? How do quantum signatures match historical records of Valdris Stitching patterns?"

The accusation hung in the air like poison.

Archon Maris spoke, her tone measured: "The economic impact of these reality fluctuations is catastrophic. Markets cannot function when history changes. Debts become meaningless when both parties remember different transactions. If this continues, the entire financial system collapses within six months."

"And my patients," Doctor Seren added, her voice surprisingly gentle, "report memories that don't belong to them. Personalities fractured across conflicting timelines. We've had seventeen suicides this month alone—people who can no longer determine which version of their life is real."

Kaelen felt the weight of their stares. Five Great Houses. Trillions of lives depending on stability. And her, standing alone on a throne she'd never wanted.

"I will find the source," she said. "Give me two weeks—"

"Two weeks?" Lady Vor laughed bitterly. "While you 'investigate,' should we watch reality crumble? No, Heir Valdris. The Conclave demands action. Immediate action."

"What do you propose?" Kaelen asked, though she already knew the answer.

Director Veyron leaned forward. "Open the Vault. Reveal what Valdris has hidden about the Thread. Let the Houses examine it together."

"The Vault is sealed by Blood Lock," Kaelen said. "Only Valdris blood can open it."

"Then open it," The Watcher said simply.

"And if I refuse?"

Lady Vor's smile was cold. "Then the Conclave will have its answer about who's responsible for this crisis. And we will respond accordingly."

A threat. Thinly veiled, but unmistakable.

Kaelen looked to Captain Reyes, who had remained silent throughout. The independent captain met her gaze and gave a slight shrug—*your choice*.

The heir of House Valdris had three options:

---

## The Choice

**Option A: Open the Vault**  
Kaelen opens the Blood-Locked Vault, revealing the Thread archives to all five Houses. This shows cooperation and transparency but risks giving away Valdris's greatest secrets—and potentially confirming that Valdris possesses Stitching knowledge.

**Consequences:**
- Gains trust from Houses Maris and Seren (diplomatic Houses)
- Risks technological theft by Houses Kaelen and Veyron
- House Vor sees it as weakness
- The true nature of the Thread is revealed to everyone
- If Valdris is hiding something, it will be exposed

---

**Option B: Negotiate with the Rebels**  
Kaelen reveals that she's discovered an underground movement in the station's lower levels—refugees and dissidents who have been experimenting with Thread fragments. She proposes using them as a neutral third party to investigate, buying time while deflecting blame from Valdris.

**Consequences:**
- Divides the Conclave (some see wisdom, others see deflection)
- Brings the rebel faction into play as a major story element
- House Vor may see this as weakness and act unilaterally
- The rebels gain legitimacy but may have their own agenda
- Keeps Valdris secrets safe for now

---

**Option C: Seal the Station**  
Kaelen declares a total lockdown of Valdris Station. No one leaves, no ships enter. She will find the source of the Stitching herself—and if any House opposes this, they reveal themselves as complicit.

**Consequences:**
- Extremely aggressive move, risks war
- House Vor respects strength but may respond with force
- Forces the true culprit to act (they can't hide if trapped)
- Economic chaos as the Conclave is held hostage
- Captain Reyes and other neutrals become allies or enemies
- Shows absolute authority but risks everything
