# Root Legacy Archive

This folder contains legacy markdown files that previously lived in repository root.

## Why moved

- Reduce root-level noise
- Keep onboarding/deployment docs easy to find
- Preserve all historical status and delivery context

## What is here

- Status snapshots
- Session summaries
- Innovation/optimization reports
- Deployment completion reports
- One-off implementation logs

If a guide from old notes appears missing in root, check this folder first.
