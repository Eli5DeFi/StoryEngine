🎭 Introducing Voidborne: The Silent Throne

The first AI-powered narrative where YOU bet on the story's direction.

Space political intrigue meets prediction markets.

Built on @base. USDC betting. $FORGE token for sustainability.

Thread 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
Most interactive fiction is predetermined.

Your "choices" don't matter—writers already decided the ending.

Voidborne is different: AI generates the story in real-time based on collective predictions.

The narrative literally adapts to what readers believe will happen.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Here's how it works:

1. 📖 Read a chapter
2. 🎲 Bet USDC on which path you think the AI will choose
3. 🤖 AI evaluates all options (narrative coherence, engagement, momentum)
4. 💰 Winners split 85% of the pool

Parimutuel betting on story outcomes.
```

**Tweet 4 (Story):**
```
The first story: VOIDBORNE - The Silent Throne

You're heir to House Valdris. Someone is Stitching new Threads—an art thought impossible.

Five houses demand answers:

What happens next? YOU decide.

### Reddit Post (r/CryptoCurrency, r/Base, r/Web3)

**Title:** "I built Voidborne: AI-generated stories meet prediction markets on Base"

```markdown
Hey everyone! I've been working on this for the past few months and just launched the MVP.

## What is Voidborne?

It's like a choose-your-own-adventure story, but instead of choosing directly, you BET on which path the AI will take next.

- AI generates a narrative chapter-by-chapter
- At each chapter, readers bet USDC on potential story branches
- AI evaluates options based on narrative quality
- Winners share 85% of the pool (parimutuel betting)

## Why Base?

- Fast & cheap transactions
- Strong ecosystem
- USDC native support
- Great dev experience

## First Story: VOIDBORNE - The Silent Throne

Space political intrigue. You're heir to a powerful house. Someone's breaking reality with forbidden magic. Five houses want answers.

3 choices available right now. Betting closes in 7 days.

## For Devs & AI Agents

I built this to be super agent-friendly:
- Full REST API (5 endpoints)
- Smart contract integration (viem/wagmi)
- Complete documentation (SKILL.md)
- 5 production-ready agent examples

Want to build an arbitrage bot? Sentiment analyzer? Market maker? Go for it.

## Try it out

### Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline:**
"AI-generated stories meet prediction markets on Base"

**Description:**
```
Voidborne is the first narrative prediction market where readers bet on story outcomes.

How it works:
1. 📖 AI generates a story chapter
2. 🎲 Readers bet USDC on which branch they think the AI will choose next
3. 🤖 AI evaluates options based on narrative coherence
4. 💰 Winners split 85% of the pool

Built on Base with USDC betting. Agent-friendly API. Self-sustaining via $FORGE token trading fees.

First story live: "VOIDBORNE: The Silent Throne" - a space political saga about forbidden magic and deadly succession politics.
```

**First Comment (Maker):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share Voidborne with you all.

This started as an experiment: "What if story outcomes were determined by prediction markets instead of predetermined scripts?"

The result is a platform where:
- AI generates high-quality narratives
- Readers stake real money on their predictions
- The story literally evolves based on collective wisdom
- Everyone can build on it (full API + agent examples)

We just launched Chapter 1 with 3 possible paths. Betting window is 7 days.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! What kind of agents would you build? What stories would you want to see?

AMA about the tech, the narrative design, or the economic model!

### Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** "Show HN: Voidborne – Bet on AI story outcomes (Base + USDC)"

```markdown
Hey HN,

I built a platform where readers bet on AI-generated story outcomes.

Project: https://voidborne.ai
Source: (private during beta, will open-source)
Demo: Live on Base mainnet

## The Idea

Traditional interactive fiction has a problem: choices are predetermined. Writers have already decided all outcomes.

Voidborne flips this: AI generates the story in real-time based on what readers BELIEVE will happen (proven by staking money).

## How It Works

1. AI writes a chapter with multiple possible continuations
2. Readers bet USDC on which branch they think the AI will choose
3. AI evaluates options (narrative coherence, engagement, story momentum)
4. AI picks the best path
5. Winners split the pot (85% payout, parimutuel betting)

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- Backend: Next.js API routes, Prisma, PostgreSQL  
- Blockchain: Foundry (Solidity), Base L2, USDC
- AI: GPT-4 + Claude for story generation

## For Developers

I built this to be maximally integrable:
- REST API (fully documented)
- Smart contracts (verified on Basescan)
- SKILL.md with 5 agent examples
- SDK coming soon

Want to build bots? Please do! Arbitrage, sentiment analysis, content generation—it's all fair game.

## Current Status

MVP launched today. Chapter 1 betting is live (7-day window, 3 choices, $10-$10K USDC).

Looking for feedback on:
- Narrative quality
- Betting UX
- API design
- Economic model
- What agents would you build?

Happy to answer questions!

## 💬 FAQ Responses (Pre-written)

**Q: "Is this legal?"**
A: Voidborne operates as a prediction market for entertainment. Users bet on AI story outcomes, not real-world events. Always check your local regulations. We recommend consulting a lawyer if you have concerns.

**Q: "How does the AI choose?"**
A: The AI evaluates options based on narrative coherence, character consistency, story momentum, and engagement potential. It's not random—it picks the best narrative path.

**Q: "What if everyone bets on the same choice?"**
A: Parimutuel odds adjust automatically. If one choice has 90% of bets, its odds will be very low (~1.1x). This creates opportunities for value bets on underdog choices.

**Q: "Can I withdraw my bet?"**
A: No, bets are final once placed (on-chain). This is by design—it ensures pool integrity and prevents gaming.

**Q: "What's the $FORGE token?"**
A: $FORGE token trading fees fund platform operations and AI compute. This makes Voidborne self-sustaining—no VCs, no ads. Token launch coming soon.

**Q: "Can I build a bot?"**
A: Absolutely! We encourage it. Download SKILL.md from our site for full API docs and agent examples. Build arbitrage bots, sentiment analyzers, whatever you want.

**Q: "What's the house edge?"**
A: 15% total: 12.5% to treasury, 2.5% to development. 85% goes to winners. This is competitive with traditional prediction markets.

**Q: "When is Chapter 2?"**
A: 7 days after Chapter 1 betting closes. The AI will reveal its choice, winners get paid, and the next chapter begins immediately.
