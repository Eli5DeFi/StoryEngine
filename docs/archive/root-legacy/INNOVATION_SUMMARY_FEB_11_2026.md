## Why These Innovations Work

**1. Network Effects**
- Each innovation attracts different user types
- Traders (Futures) + Storytellers (AI Agents) + Strategists (Influence) + Social (Guilds)
- Cross-pollination creates ecosystem

**2. Infinite Switching Cost**
- Once you have: Influence balance + Open positions + Guild membership + Character bonds
- → Can't leave without losing everything

**3. Viral Loops**
- Character agents create shareable content (Twitter, TikTok)
- Guilds drive invites (5-20 friends per guild)
- Adaptive stories create word-of-mouth (unpredictability)

**4. Progression Systems**
- Influence accumulation (RPG-style power growth)
- Guild ranks & tournaments (competitive)
- Futures P&L (financial)
- Streaks & achievements (gamification)

   - Build Influence Economy (2 weeks)
   - Build Futures Market MVP (4 weeks)
   - A/B test Adaptive AI (1 week)

3. **Beta Launch** (Week 8)
