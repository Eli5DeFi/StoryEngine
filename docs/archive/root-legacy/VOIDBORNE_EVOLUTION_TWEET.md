# Voidborne Evolution - Twitter Thread

## Tweet 1 (Hook)

🎲 We just shipped a feature that will 10x engagement on @Voidborne_AI

Real-time betting odds dashboard with live market visualization.

Here's what we built 🧵👇

---

## Tweet 2 (Problem)

The Problem:

Users were placing bets and leaving immediately.

❌ No visibility into market sentiment
❌ Static betting interface
❌ Low engagement
❌ No reason to come back

Average time on page: 2 minutes
Bets per user: 1.2

We needed to change this.

---

## Tweet 3 (Solution Overview)

The Solution:

Real-Time Betting Odds Dashboard

Two core components:
1️⃣ Live Odds Chart (time-series)
2️⃣ Community Consensus Gauge (sentiment)

Now users can WATCH the market, not just participate in it.

---

## Tweet 4 (Live Odds Chart)

Feature #1: Live Odds Chart 📊

Shows how betting odds change over time:
• Multiple time intervals (5m, 15m, 1h, 6h, 24h)
• Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
• Color-coded lines for each choice
• Smooth Recharts animations

Users can spot trends and bet strategically.

## Tweet 5 (Consensus Gauge)

Feature #2: Community Consensus Gauge 🎯

Radial gauge showing:
• What % of bettors support each choice
• Confidence level (Very High → Very Low)
• Trend (rising/falling/stable)
• Leading choice highlighted

"⚡ 82% of bettors think Choice A will win"

## Tweet 6 (Technical Architecture)

How it works (tech details):

🗄️ OddsSnapshot model (time-series data)
📡 Cron job captures odds every 5 minutes
🔌 Two API endpoints:
   • /api/betting/odds-history/[poolId]
   • /api/betting/consensus/[poolId]

Built with Next.js 14, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Recharts.

---

## Tweet 7 (User Psychology)

Why this works:

🧠 Psychological triggers:

1. FOMO - "82% think Choice A will win"
2. Contrarian Appeal - "18% = 5.5x payout!"
3. Real-Time Excitement - Dopamine from watching shifts
4. Social Proof - "38 bettors chose this"
5. Status - "I called it at 20-80 odds!"
