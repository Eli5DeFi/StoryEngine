## 🔮 Top Pick: Psychic Consensus Oracle

**The most novel, viral, and immediately implementable innovation.**

The PCO adds a **second prediction market on top of the story betting pool**:
- Readers bet on story choices (Layer 1) — unchanged
- Readers also bet on **whether the crowd consensus will be correct** (Layer 2)
- Correct contrarians (who bet crowd will fail) earn a **2× bonus payout**
- Psychic ELO leaderboard: SEER → ORACLE → PROPHET → VOID SEER

**POC Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Smart contract: `packages/psychic-oracle/src/PsychicConsensusOracle.sol`
- TypeScript SDK: `packages/psychic-oracle/src/client.ts`
- Test suite: 22 test cases covering all scenarios
- Branch: `innovation/psychic-consensus-oracle`

## 🚀 Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1-8:** PCO launch ($192K/year unlocked)
2. **Week 9-14:** Yield-bearing pools ($45K/year unlocked)
3. **Week 15-22:** Chronicle Engine ($8K/year, massive retention driver)
4. **Week 23-28:** Temporal Multiplier Betting ($10K/year)
5. **Week 29-40:** Narrative DNA System ($5K/year, deep moat)

## 🔑 Key Insight

> "The difference between a game and an addiction is depth of meta-gameplay."

Layer 1: Predict the AI's story choice.  
Layer 2: Predict whether the crowd will be right.  
Layer 3: Decode the hidden DNA governing all decisions.

**Three levels of prediction. No narrative market on earth does this.**
